        <h3>I Opened a Book</h3>

        <!-- This is the quote section -->
        <div class="poem">
            <blockquote>
                “I opened a book and in I strode. <br />
                Now nobody can find me. <br />
                I’ve left my chair, my house, my road,<br />
                My town and my world behind me. <br />
                I’m wearing the cloak, I’ve slipped on the ring, <br />
                I’ve swallowed the magic potion. <br />
                I’ve fought with a dragon, dined with a king <br />
                And dived in a bottomless ocean. <br />
                I opened a book and made some friends. <br />
                I shared their tears and laughter <br />
                And followed their road with its bumps and bends <br />
                To the happily ever after. <br />
                I finished my book and out I came. <br />
                The cloak can no longer hide me. <br />
                My chair and my house are just the same, <br />
                But I have a book inside me.”
